# mahjong-solitaire
Mahjong Solitaire (One of my first coding projects).

Dug this baby up from the nether-regions of my old HD and thought I'd post it to GitHub (so the world can judge my newbie programming skills).
It's the game, Mahjong Solitaire, written in Java. There aren't many different configurations uploaded but I find it still pretty addictive.
To play, just clone and run the .jar file in the repository. That should do it.
